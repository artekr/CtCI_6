 *
 * There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
 *    insert a character
 *    remove a character
 *    replace a character.
 * Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 * pale, ple -> true
 * pales, pale -> true
 * pale, bale -> true
 * pale, bake -> false
 *
