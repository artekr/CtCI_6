### Chapter 3 Stacks and Queues

#### Stack
A stack uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering. That is, as in a stack of dinner plates, the most recent item added to 
the stack is the first item to be removed.

It uses the following operations:
* **_pop()_**: Remove the top item from the stack. 
* **_push(item)_**: Add an item to the top of the stack. 
* **_peek()_**: Return the top of the stack.
* **_isEmpty()_**: Return true if and only if the stack is empty.

#### Queue
A queue implements FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering. As in a line or queue at a ticket stand, items are removed from 
the data structure in the same order that they are added.

It uses the operations:
* **_add(item)_**: Add an item to the end of the list.
* **_remove()_**: Remove the  rst item in the list.
* **_peek()_**: Return the top of the queue.
* **_isEmpty()_**: Return true if and only if the queue is empty.
