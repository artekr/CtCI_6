### Chapter 4 Trees and Graphs

#### Tree

* Types of Tree
    * Trees vs. Binary Trees
    * Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree
        * _BST: all left descendents <= n < all right descendents_
    * Balanced vs. Unbalanced
        * _Red-black trees (Balanced)_
        * _AVL trees (Balanced)_
    * Complete Binary Trees
        * _Every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level_

    * Full Binary Trees
        * _every node has either zero or two children_
        ![](./img/fullBT.png)
    * Perfect Binary Trees
        * _Both full and complete_

* Binary Tree Traversal
    * In-Order Traversal
    * Pre-Order Traversal
    * Post-Order Traversal
    
* Binary Heaps
    * Min-Heaps
    * Max-Heaps

* Tries (Prefix Trees)

#### Graph

* Graph Representation
    * Adjacency List
    * Adjacency Matrices
    
* Graph Search
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Bidirectional Search
